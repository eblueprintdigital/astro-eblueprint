 Clann Investments was created to better represent their new portfolio of financial services. e-blueprint were engaged to develop GETS branding and we delighted to be asked to create this new exciting brand. Clann was borne from the Scottish roots Director's Taryn and Scott share and create to embody the trust, transparency and warmth of personality Clann Investments bring to their customers. The branding felt right from the beginning and talks to the traditions of the highlands and secure investments.

Clann have engaged e-blueprint to build a social media and website strategy and deliver a digital marketing campaign.
