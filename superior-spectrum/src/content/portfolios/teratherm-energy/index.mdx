<TextBlock title='Bringing a new Geothermal energy product to market'>
  Teratherm is one of those exciting products that can be difficult to
  understand, but once you do, the eureka moment opens the floodgates to a range
  of possibilities. e-blueprint helped distil Teratherm's power through branding
  and communications, showcasing how it harnesses geothermal energy.

<TextBlockV2 title='Exhibition â€“ Marketing materials'>
  With a last minute space secured at the Grand Designs Exhibition, we created
  the teratherm's 3m x 3m exhibition stand featuring double corners, reception
  desks, along with flyers, folders, business cards, T-shirts, and a digital
  landing page for lead generation after the event.

  We developed the website to provide an effortlessly simple browsing experience
  that enables customers to navigate, explore, and understand the benefits of
  geothermal energy easily. The website is optimised and constructed with
  WordPress blocks for superfast loading and optimised for search engines.
  <br />
  With complete control through a customised, user-friendly content management
  system (CMS) website, they can promote new products, special offers, and
  discounts. A straightforward sign-up feature assists in building their
  customer database.

<Quote author='Liam Smith, Managing Director.'>
  We were impressed at how quickly e-blueprint understood how we wanted to
  present the company. Their guidance and support during a change and the need
  to show the business as an established brand were a big part of this exercise.
  The detail and thought that went into understanding our product translated
  beautifully to help customers understand a complex and technical product,
  which helped when we were at Grand Designs. We also greatly appreciated the
  extra out-of-hours work and effort they put into getting the website and
  everything we needed for the exhibition.
