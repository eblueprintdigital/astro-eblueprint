<TextBlock title='Assisted, secure and accessible transport solutions'>
  Apex Management Solutions approached us to create a responsive 'accessible for
  all' website to raise awareness of their safe, reliable and efficient services
  for a wide variety of customers, ranging from sectors such as education,
  medical, hospitality, and security.

<TextBlockV2 title="A UI and UX that's accessible for all">
  We brought together a website that functioned for a range of users, such as
  drivers, guardians, care organisations, and people with disabilities. One of
  the key requirements for Apex was to make the website adaptable for all of
  their many clients, such as catering for visual impairments. So, website
  accessibility was essential and demonstrated the attitude and dedication that
  Apex brought to their service delivery.
