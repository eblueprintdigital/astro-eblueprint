<TextBlock title='The good times are back'>
  Camp & Furnace approached us to help build them a website that allowed them to
  present their events effortlessly across all platforms.

The key to a beautiful and visual frontend was an equally impressive
administration through the website's back-end. This was fully customised to put
administration personnel in full control in order to develop and adapt events on
the fly.

<TextBlockV2 title='A dynamic backend'>
  A fully tailored back-end system that is personalised for Camp designers and
  marketing team. It gives full control to the customer with bespoke slideshow
  options, custom events pages, bespoke blog pages and a function for setting
  time sensitive page releases.
</TextBlockV2>

<TextBlock title='Bespoke and intuitive forms'>
  With five rooms and a wealth of events, Camp and Furnace required more than
  one or two standard forms. Through a strategic approach, we ensured that each
  event was tailored to specific rooms, and ensured that these forms went to the
  right person and manager.
</TextBlock>

<TextBlockV2 title='Build trust in time'>
  We built a comprehensive timeline that features breakout moments in Camp and
  Furnaces history.
</TextBlockV2>

<TextBlock title='Sliders redefined'>
  A bespoke slider was crucial for Camp and Furnace to illustrate the various
  nights and themes. Not only did we make this possible, but we ensured that it
  worked efficiently.
</TextBlock>

<DraggableSlider images={images} />

<TextBlockV2 title='A custom administration'>
  We enabled Camp and Furnace to have full control over all aspects of their
  website.
</TextBlockV2>

<TextBlock title='Events made easy'>
  A flexible and easy-to-use system to manage events, mark featured events, and
  support a fast moving business with the ability to represent and feature
  separate events that could happen simultaneously across the five distinct
  rooms within Camp and Furnace.
</TextBlock>

<TextBlockV2 title='Easy Navigation and custom areas'>
  Each key section of the website is divided into its own area, keeping
  navigation and administration easy and quick to use.
