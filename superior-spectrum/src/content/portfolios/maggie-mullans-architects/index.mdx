<TextBlock title='Grand designs redefined'>
  Maggie Mullan Architects required a website to show the scale and importance
  of the work they do. Having worked with Maggie for many years, it was a
  project of great significance for us. We wanted to truly reflect the
  competence and capability within her practice.
  <br />
  We worked through many sessions with MMA to find a narrative that best
  represents the ethos and approach to how MMA develops and delivers their
  projects. It was important to create branding that clearly showed the depth
  and importance of what they deliver for clients and the wider community.
  <br />
  We delivered a site that showcases the next generation of MMA’s nationally
  important projects that have come to fruition.

<TextBlockV2 title='The anatomy of the MMA brand'>
  A true brand identity has been developed and executed through a beautifully
  crafted logo. As a spearhead for the business, it creates an impression that
  has helped define MMA’s merits whilst building trust amongst MMA’s peers. The
  value MMA brings to a project comes through in all aspects of their branding,
  including the copy and photography, to present one cohesive offering that
  works online as it does in practice.
