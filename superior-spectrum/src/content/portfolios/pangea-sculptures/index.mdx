<TextBlock title='Bringing the majesty of Africa into your home…'>
  Deriving their name from the ancient supercontinent, Pangea Sculptures have
  brought the roaming, roaring wildlife of Africa into homes, gardens and
  businesses across the UK and Europe through beautifully crafted sculptures.
  <br />
  Their admiration of wildlife has gone from strength-to-strength, with Pangea
  also raising awareness and funds for several charities, including Born Free
  and the Purple Poppy Appeal.

<TextBlockV2 title='Covering all the bases'>
  We assisted Pangea by developing an easy-to-use e-commerce and checkout system
  with an integrated payment gateway. The website acted as the hub for all their
  marketing activity, which included email marketing with incentives to build
  social and email contacts. We implemented quarterly marketing campaigns to
  drive sales and promotions during key periods throughout the year. On a
  monthly basis, we optimised all aspects of search engines, paid searches and
  social content to create routine reports and inform the next month’s marketing
  effort.

<TextBlock title='Mobile and PWAs'>
  Building the website mobile first ensured all aspects functioned properly
  online alongside e-commerce. Using Powerful Web App (PWA) technology,
  customers received the opportunity to add the website as an app icon to their
  phone, ensuring ease of use and a faster mobile experience.

  Pangea Sculptures has been working with Nick Taylor and the team at
  e-blueprint for the past four years. During this time, we have built an
  excellent working relationship with the team.
  <br />
  Initially, Nick and the team began helping us with a website design four years
  ago and from then e-blueprint has continued to support our business across all
  our e-commerce and marketing platforms. e-blueprint have always been
  responsive to our requests, and willing to share ideas and techniques to
  enhance our business model.
  <br />
  Nick is a very professional individual; a dedicated account manager who is
  forward thinking and focused on our goals; communication has always been
  excellent. The team, here and at e-blueprint, work well together and I would
  not hesitate to recommend their services to any business wanting a consistent,
  professional approach to web development, e-commerce integration, design and
  marketing.
