title: 'University Technical Colleges UTCs'
description: "We engaged e-blueprint to deliver Liverpoolâ€™s three UTC school websites and the new website for Northern School Trust. Thanks to their on-going support over the last three years, we've gone on to produce engaging and bespoke functionality, such as course finders for our schools and ways to engage students looking for a new school, from in-page analytics to Mailchimp newsletters. We continue to work with them on a number of SEO, PPC and web development projects. Their creative design, web development and overall technical ability to deliver the work we need, when we need it: this is always delivered quickly and to a high quality."
