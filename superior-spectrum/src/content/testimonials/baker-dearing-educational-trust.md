title: Baker Dearing Educational Trust
description: e-blueprint really understood the complex requirements for our education website, UTColleges.org. Nick and his team worked tirelessly and very creatively to produce an engaging and comprehensive website. Further to this, and at short notice, we commissioned e-blueprint to build a website for our charity bakerdearing.org from scratch. They were easy to work with, took a simple brief and turned it into a site with real impact, and in doing so kept to an ambitious timescale. Thanks again for your excellent support. No doubt, weâ€™ll be back in touch soon!
