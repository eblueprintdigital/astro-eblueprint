## Utilising your customer journey is a great reference when considering ways of improving the customer experience.

In this step, we will focus on how to utilise your freshly formed [marketing strategy](/news/creating-a-branding-and-marketing-strategy/) and [brand narratives](/news/brand-narratives-and-storytelling/) to discover new ways to improve customer experience. Delivering engaging and well thought through communications will encourage your customers to engage with your service delivery. It's easy to think your main focus should be your end goal, such as your 'Checkout'/'Booking' page. But the customer experience isn't restricted to the final action. Instead, we call this the customer journey and it looks like this:

**Awareness -** this is where your customers become aware that they need something. They may be experiencing a problem or dilemma and recognise that they require a solution. This is a great place to initiate some market research so that you are fully aware of what this market gap is and how your company and products/services can fill it. The awareness stage applies just as much to you as it does to your customers.

**Consideration -** now that your customer has established that they require a solution, they will start exploring different companies to see which product/service matches their criteria. Often, customers will compare multiple companies before purchasing. Here, you need to make sure that you're showcasing your unique selling points to stand out amongst the crowd.

**Decision -** With great **awareness** stage research, and USPs successfully featuring in the **consideration** stage, then the customer will arrive here. The decision stage is where the customer decides on what they are purchasing who they are purchasing from.

Keeping these steps in mind, you can layout your content and website to expertly guide your customer through your customer journey. You’ll be able to capture their awareness, encourage their consideration and initiate their decision. From this, natural customer “touch points” will appear that you can map out to further understand. By “touch points”, we are referring to key areas where customers interact with your site or marketing approach.

For example, imagine your customers are driving to a destination and there are multiple twists and turns in the road. These twists and turns are the areas in your website or marketing approach that steer your customers to their destination, aka what you’re selling to them. Making sure that these turns are as easy to navigate as possible will keep the driver motivated to keep going. The last thing that the driver will want to see are obstacles and potholes making those turns even more off-putting, and these are any incomplete areas in your approach or anything that needs improving.

A service mapping exercise will provide you with a visual map of your customer journey so that you can confidently identify where these “touch points” are and start to explore ways in which you can improve your customers’ experiences. Your [content development plan](/news/brand-narratives-and-storytelling/) can come in really handy here as you can keep track of which customer journey optimisations work. Naturally, when undertaking this exercise with your team, you’ll also notice improvements to your communications, delivery processes, shortcuts, and problems. All of these can put you on the right track to high quality service improvements.

Your website is one of the key communication hubs where a lot of all your marketing and PR efforts will be channelled, so you should always be looking for new ways to improve your site navigation. Utilising your website to help manage, reduce administration, and facilitate your customers’ needs and requests will be a huge help to you too, as well as your customers. Connecting the dots for your customers to ensure a smooth service delivery is key to strengthening your relationship with them and, when done well, it also helps re-enforce your brand.
