## Utilising your customer journey is a great reference when considering ways of improving the customer experience.

In this step, we will focus on how to utilise your freshly formed [marketing strategy](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/blog/creating-a-branding-and-marketing-strategy/) and [brand narratives](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/blog/brand-narratives-and-storytelling/) to discover new ways to improve customer experience. Delivering engaging and well thought through communications will encourage your customers to engage with your service delivery. It's easy to think your main focus should be your end goal, such as your 'Checkout'/'Booking' page. But the customer experience isn't restricted to the final action. Instead, we call this the customer journey and it looks like this:

**Awareness -** this is where your customers become aware that they need something. They may be experiencing a problem or dilemma and recognise that they require a solution. This is a great place to initiate some market research so that you are fully aware of what this market gap is and how your company and products/services can fill it. The awareness stage applies just as much to you as it does to your customers.

**Consideration -** now that your customer has established that they require a solution, they will start exploring different companies to see which product/service matches their criteria. Often, customers will compare multiple companies before purchasing. Here, you need to make sure that you're showcasing your unique selling points to stand out amongst the crowd.

**Decision -** With great **awareness** stage research, and USPs successfully featuring in the **consideration** stage, then the customer will arrive here. The decision stage is where the customer decides on what they are purchasing who they are purchasing from.
