Voice activation is no longer ‘the future’. Voice activated SEO is here, and now, and it works. We have seen voice activation soar in popularity over the last two or three years. Whether it’s through our phones with applications like Siri, or through purpose-built devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, voice activation search technologies are fast becoming part of the landscape of everyday modern life. In fact, some studies believe that voice searches will make up 50% of online searches by the time 2020 comes around!

Although in most cases, this does not mean you have to completely overhaul your SEO strategy, you are going to want to consider a little tweaking. Here are a few tips on how to best optimize your business for voice activated SEO.

## **1\. Language**

Most likely, the SEO you currently use on your site is based on the keywords you are most likely to see typed into a search bar. However, people speak in a very different way to how they type.

Essentially, when people are searching via voice activation they use more casual language and speak in long-form. Therefore, in terms of SEO, you need to think about implementing phrases and longtail keywords as opposed to just short search terms.

For example: Where one might type ‘best pizza near me’ into a search bar, into a voice activated search you might say something like ‘where can I get the best pizza near me’. Have a think about how your customers speak, and implement this into your SEO strategy accordingly.
