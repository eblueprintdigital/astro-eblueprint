Protecting your [brand identity](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/services/brand-identity/) and reputation is a cornerstone for every business. With our branding experience, we've outlined some key considerations and actions you can use to stave off any unforeseen mishaps. Visit our work with events like [Northern Vision’s International Tennis Tournaments](https://northern-vision.co.uk/events/williams-bmw-liverpool-international/), which has illustrated this effective logo use.

Businesses that use a brand development thought process save the time and expense of settling for something less than perfect. They can also avoid having to compromise and make changes to fit in with a certain media. When we prepare company logos for their sponsorship packages, the biggest issues arise from poorly executed branding. The extra time and wasted expense clients have to go to shoehorn an established but poorly prepared logo means that in some cases the branding just doesn’t stand up. Their logo has to work across a myriad of materials, such as newspapers, livery, emails and various website spaces. The most robust logos manage the transfer and convert well across various platforms, capable of being translated to pure colour such as white. The logos that make the most impact are simple, clear and work are recognisable across a variety of use.

#### These are some criteria that we use to establish an effective brand image:

- Clean, consistent design focuses your customer’s attention on specific parts of the page. This helps to ease them through your content and any buying process!
- If you are e-commerce based, at least 3-5 shots of your product – from different angles – help customers make potentially tricky online purchasing decisions.
- Colour has a massive emotional effect. If people can only see the colours you use from a distance, they’ll already be making subconscious decisions about you and what you do…
- Good, clear typography tells your customers EXACTLY what you want them to do.
- Bespoke imagery shows people you’re serious about your business and prepared to invest in it.
