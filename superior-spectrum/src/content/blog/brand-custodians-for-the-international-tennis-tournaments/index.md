Protecting your [brand identity](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/services/brand-identity/) and reputation is a cornerstone for every business. With our branding experience, we've outlined some key considerations and actions you can use to stave off any unforeseen mishaps. Visit our work with events like [Northern Vision’s International Tennis Tournaments](https://northern-vision.co.uk/events/williams-bmw-liverpool-international/), which has illustrated this effective logo use.

Businesses that use a brand development thought process save the time and expense of settling for something less than perfect. They can also avoid having to compromise and make changes to fit in with a certain media. When we prepare company logos for their sponsorship packages, the biggest issues arise from poorly executed branding. The extra time and wasted expense clients have to go to shoehorn an established but poorly prepared logo means that in some cases the branding just doesn’t stand up. Their logo has to work across a myriad of materials, such as newspapers, livery, emails and various website spaces. The most robust logos manage the transfer and convert well across various platforms, capable of being translated to pure colour such as white. The logos that make the most impact are simple, clear and work are recognisable across a variety of use.

## These are some criteria that we use to establish an effective brand image:

- Clean, consistent design focuses your customer’s attention on specific parts of the page. This helps to ease them through your content and any buying process!
- If you are e-commerce based, at least 3-5 shots of your product – from different angles – help customers make potentially tricky online purchasing decisions.
- Colour has a massive emotional effect. If people can only see the colours you use from a distance, they’ll already be making subconscious decisions about you and what you do…
- Good, clear typography tells your customers EXACTLY what you want them to do.
- Bespoke imagery shows people you’re serious about your business and prepared to invest in it.

When your company is in the position to show off to the world, first impressions count, the fundamentals of a strong logo are key. However, it’s not just the logo so much as the thought process behind the brand that helps establish your business’s story and how well that is showcased to the world.

## Key factors to creating your brand:

- Design your logo that reflects your business culture and customers. Colour palettes, fonts and icons will all have an affect and can illicit a negative or positive emotional response.
- What’s the story behind the brand? What are the key messages about you that people will like? Is your company workforce on board and does it resonate with your customers?
- Test out your logo across a variety of media, so it works in print, online and on signage. Do you know the spot colours, pantones and RGB values for your colour palette. Is that documented in your brand guidelines?
- Make sure you know whether you fonts are web safe or can be reproduced and are licensed for your use.
- Extend your branding and see how it works across stationery and other advertising.
- Develop your key brand messages across an advertising campaign and target audience.
- Does your brand have a tone of voice in print and for audio? How well do your messages play out well on the radio?
- Test the strength of those messages with key focus groups.

The basics are to get a solid business identity from the get-go. Whether your ready to launch into full advertising campaign or just starting with your business identity. If the core assets are prepared well, you’ll save your business that cost many times over and when it comes to it, relax in the fact it’ll always look good.
