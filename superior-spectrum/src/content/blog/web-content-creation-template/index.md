To get you started, we've developed a web content creation template. Here, we have divided the content you need for a website into seven key areas. They may not reflect everything you do, and you may decide that you don't need all of these pages, but it'll give you a pretty good starting point if you can complete this.

We know how difficult it can be to create content, but making sure that you set a style and tone for your website will help you start to sell your products or service. This template helps you create the sort of info that your customers are looking for. You can either jot down a few ideas on paper for our copywriters to edit and proof for you or use our voice recording equipment to make a note of it all to be typed it up later.

We recommend that you answer the following questions and come up with your content in a team; it's amazing how differently two people can think about the same product or service. There's no such thing as a better opinion, but a range of views really helps to sculpt an even more refined picture. If you're a sole trader or starting a new business, try doing this exercise with a family member/friend/adviser. Even if someone doesn't know everything about your business, getting an outside opinion is just as essential, as they could ask lots of tricky questions to help you explain your ideas much more clearly.

The pages we're creating are:

- Homepage
- Who we are
- What we do
- Resources
- Ts&Cs/ FAQs
- Blog
- Contact us
