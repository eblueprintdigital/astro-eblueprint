**Email marketing techniques are often overlooked when it comes to building a loyal audience base. If you already have an email address or business card it stands to reason you have had some contact with that person already and formed a good impression (unless you’ve bought an email list of course… and therefore do not collect £200 and do not pass GO!).**

Think of all that time and effort you have put into building your contact database. It’s probably a mix of customers from the distant past, active customers or engagements from networking groups. It’s also likely that as time goes by you’re failing to act on and re-engage with these people. Does it feel it's all getting a bit awkward to talk with these people again? …well that’s a judgement call for you but remember, there was a mutual interest there at some point. Conduct a [digital marketing review](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/services/digital-marketing-liverpool/) of those relationships and think about whether you have something meaningful to say to these people again and you will be starting a key re-marketing process.

People are typically a forgiving bunch and understand how hectic our lives can be. People do also remember people so it’s likely they would be happy to be contacted by you, even if some years have gone by. If you’re got something to say, look to re-engage with people that you’ve met in the past. Utilise your email marketing techniques to re-start your relationship and offer them something that you think might help. A little helpful knowledge may just be the starting block to help build your reputation as the ‘go-to’ business for your service or product…
