For now, here are some tips on how to get your foot off that starting line and set a marketing budget.

Start small before going for the big bucks. To work out how to set a marketing budget and your ROI, we recommend using any monthly or annual expenses and estimations to calculate expected revenue, profit, and agree on a limit for your expenses (a budget). Your budget will, to some extent, dictate which marketing tools are best for the job, such as having enough to fund a long-running Google Ads campaign or opting for a shorter monthly campaign to try it out. Assess the ROI in year one before calculating your future year's potential profit per customer and how you can scale your business based on these numbers.
