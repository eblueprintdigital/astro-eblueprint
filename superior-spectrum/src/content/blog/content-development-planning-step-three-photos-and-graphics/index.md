## **Once you’ve got content ready for your blogs and social media posts, you can use these two handy tools to create and resize graphics.**

## Microsoft Paint

Microsoft Paint is like a free version of Adobe’s Photoshop tool. It allows you to downscale and resize images so that they fit the dimensions you need for your blogs, which are set at 348x348. For consistency on the hub page, it’s good to have a consistent size or create your own graphics.

## Canva

Once you’ve decided on your Facebook and Twitter posts, you can use Canva to create graphics to accompany them. Canva provides you with automatically-created graphics for each platform – you just slot in your choice of image, add text, a URL or phone number, and then download them. It’s an easy way to create content for specific promotions and blogs.

Above all, have fun with your blogging… You’ll soon get a feel for what customers respond to, and what works best. The point of social media is to be authentic, genuine and show people a glimpse of you as a business in a digital environment. Make sure you use your expertise and insights – they’re what set you apart from the competition!
