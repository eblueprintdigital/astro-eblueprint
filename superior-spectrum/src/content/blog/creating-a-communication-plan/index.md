## ![](images/icon-step3-1.jpg)**Create a communication plan for your customers to ensure that you know what to say, how to say it and when to say it.**

Now you're confident that you've established your [target customer](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/blog/identify-your-target-customer/), they are going to be as excited as you are to find the right fit for their needs in your services. With that in mind, making a great first impression counts, so itâ€™s important to talk their language. Making sure that you're creating an excellent communication plan in place is the best way to achieve this.

A communication plan is a strategy in which you map out the best way to stay in contact with your customers. It's a great way of maintaining customer loyalty and transforming leads into sales. It can come in many forms, such as social media posts, email updates, SMS updates, newsletters, and even website navigation. It delivers a personal form of contact directed to whichever stage of the buyer's journey your customers are in.

When creating a communication plan, a few questions may come to mind:

_Is the message/offer refined enough or do I need to reassess it?_

_Is this the right word to use? Would using a diagram be a better way of explaining this?_

_Is this too much for the customer to read? Should I break this up over my website?_

_Am I waffling on or am I being too vague?_

_How do I keep my website visitors interested?_
