## **![](images/icon-step2-1.jpg)Identify your target customer and consider their natural strategic alignment to your services.**

Your target customer is the blueprint of your audience market and all of your marketing efforts. It's a concept that is constantly evolving and adapting to changing trends and evolutions in your business. Sometimes businesses wait for their target customer to reveal themselves. But who knows how long this could take!

Instead, the key to business success is to stay confident and take control of who you are and what you do. It's important to recognise that **you** can decide who you want to market your business towards. Once you have established who you want your ideal customer to be, your strategy will instantly start to take shape. Remember, marketing isn't about trying to promote something that you don't fully believe in. So, once you're confident in who you want to target your efforts towards and why then the world of digital marketing will suddenly become a whole lot easier for you.
