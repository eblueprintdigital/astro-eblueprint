## The key to developing an effective branding and marketing strategy is showcasing your story. It’s important to make it easy for customers to relate to you, your business, and understand your offer.

Now that you've established your [communication plan](/news/creating-a-communication-plan/), it's time to nail how you're going to display the rest of your business' content. Branding is how you present your company to the public. It distinguishes you from your competitors and showcases what makes you unique. A marketing strategy plans how you will display your branding and what techniques you will use to do so. It focuses on what your customers are looking for, when they are looking, where they are looking, and how best to utilise this information to your brand's advantage. To create the most effective branding and marketing strategy, you need to further solidify **who you are**. A great way to pin this down is to create a brand **mission, vision** and list of **key principles** that can be defined by the following.

**Mission** - your mission is what you have created your business to do. What is the product or service that you're presenting? What market gap are you filling?

**Vision** - your vision is where you hope your business will go or what you hope it will achieve. Consider a change you want to see in your industry, such as developing a specific process or enhancing product delivery.

**Key Principles** - these are the standards to which you hold your company. They demonstrate your ethics and approach across all aspects of your service and product delivery, specifically through your communication and engagement strategy. This helps your staff, stakeholders, and suppliers to keep your communications on brand and message.

If you’re struggling to pin down your mission, vision, or key principles, we recommend using your greatest asset… your customers!

No one can relay your story better than your customers because they are the people who are the first to spot and identify your unique selling points. Take note and make sure that everyone in your team is aware of which factors and attributes should be taking priority. If your customers are praising something, don’t hide it away in the back of your website or emails. Instead, showcase it at the forefront of your communications, right where it belongs. There are many ways to gather this, such as surveys, customer reviews, videos, and testimonials. Evidencing this throughout your communications helps reinforce your brand and keeps your team happy.

Ultimately, a reinforced brand helps ensure that your communications are consistent. Your key principles can create a set of content guidelines for your brand and communications, so that everyone sings from the same tune – especially when it comes to writing style, photographic style and the use of your logo!
