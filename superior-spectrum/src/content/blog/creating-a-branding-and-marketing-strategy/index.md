## The key to developing an effective branding and marketing strategy is showcasing your story. Itâ€™s important to make it easy for customers to relate to you, your business, and understand your offer.

Now that you've established your [communication plan](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/blog/creating-a-communication-plan/), it's time to nail how you're going to display the rest of your business' content. Branding is how you present your company to the public. It distinguishes you from your competitors and showcases what makes you unique. A marketing strategy plans how you will display your branding and what techniques you will use to do so. It focuses on what your customers are looking for, when they are looking, where they are looking, and how best to utilise this information to your brand's advantage. To create the most effective branding and marketing strategy, you need to further solidify **who you are**. A great way to pin this down is to create a brand **mission, vision** and list of **key principles** that can be defined by the following.

**Mission** - your mission is what you have created your business to do. What is the product or service that you're presenting? What market gap are you filling?

**Vision** - your vision is where you hope your business will go or what you hope it will achieve. Consider a change you want to see in your industry, such as developing a specific process or enhancing product delivery.

**Key Principles** - these are the standards to which you hold your company. They demonstrate your ethics and approach across all aspects of your service and product delivery, specifically through your communication and engagement strategy. This helps your staff, stakeholders, and suppliers to keep your communications on brand and message.
