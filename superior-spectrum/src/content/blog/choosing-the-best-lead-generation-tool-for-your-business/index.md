**Finding the right lead generation tool, or indeed the right combination of lead generation tools can be difficult. It is especially difficult when there are so many tools out there with so many applications, algorithms and variations in effect. Where do you start? Well, hopefully, we can give you some ideas here. So, you are about to dive in and snap up a new lead generation tool. But before you do ask yourself these questions…**

## What is the level of visitors to your website already (leads) and what activity is driving them to your website (lead generation)?

There is a belief in lead generation that you have a glut of hidden customers engaging with your business, they are interested, but they aren’t buying. It is virtually impossible to glean live information about who is using your site without a lead generation tool, like Lead Forensics, for example, to dig up this information for you.

Lead Forensics can catch up with these users in a couple of ways. If the users are new, fresh leads, the tool can alert you, and after that can quite easily research the company of origin and the correct person to open communications with. Alternatively, if a web hit comes from a consumer that you have already engaged, you can track to see when they are on your website and what they looked at, which gives you some vital insider information to get ahead and approach the lead. But here’s the thing; you’ll need to work out the excuse for tracking down and engaging with them. The thing is, you must ask yourself, how can you better engage with prospective customers and still be natural about it?

[Analysis](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/services/user-experience-tracking-and-analytics/) is useful and interesting. The tool covers touchpoints within your website to resources, key niche services, blogs, white papers and products. This helps to see what is garnering interest on your site and what is not. What money you have spent well, and what you haven’t.

But, is the website traffic you are receiving big enough to justify the expense of a tool? This is an important question. This is what you have to weigh up before you take the plunge!

## Are you making the most of the tools that you have now?

If you considering increasing your conversions, you need to review the tools you have and the conversion you already get. It generally benefits a business to use a combination of tools; you certainly should be if you are dealing with quite heavy traffic!

This is the combination we use: We have Google Analytics to review trends of the past and the content users are looking for. We cross-reference this with the goals and conversions websites receive. We then take it a step further and engage with Google Tag Manager, to find out the most important interactions such as ‘button clicks’ on application forms and other in-page analytics; this helps to understand what users are doing on your web pages. There’s also a Google in-page analytics tool. This highlights which content gets the most customer attention.

All of these are free tools! They are a really good place to start in terms of analysing the effectiveness of the content on your site.

Also, when considering implementing new tools, it is worth noting that, with GDPR coming in this year, you may need to change your data handling practices, paying particular attention to your ‘opt in’ as opposed to ‘opt out’ system.

Hopefully this has given you some food for thought!

## How to close your leads loop?

Lead Forensics goes some way in determining the source of your traffic. What can be frustrating is trying to work out what advertising channel is the most effective. Most likely, it is a multi-channel process, so you will need to look at Google’s attribution modeling report to find out what works best.

[Ruler Analytics](https://www.ruleranalytics.com/) provides some great insights into both your first click traffic source, and the last click source, when an action like a sale or a form is completed. In addition, it closes part of the marketing loop by assigning telephone calls to the source of traffic. This enables you to pick up the offline sales. These can be fed into a marketing channel to give you a fairer appreciation of where traffic comes from and at what point calls, enquiries and sales take place.

## Some actionable points for 2018:

- Firstly, ensure you have all the basic Google analytics tools in place.
- Experiment with tracking all your online marketing with UTM codes and Google Segments
- Look into the usability of your web page and ensure it is at optimum accessibility. Video User Testing is a great tool when it comes to working this out.
- Make sure that there is a plan in place for your website development, and that it is being actioned.
- Look at the other tools (Ruler Analytics or Lead Forensics, for example) for more detailed insight.
- Try some A/B testing. This helps increase conversion rates.
- Engage the customers you have.
- Ensure that your e-mail marketing and engagement protocols are in line with your GDPR legal requirements.
