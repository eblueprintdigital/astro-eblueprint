## **Making sure that you use a mobile friendly website design is the first step towards making your website multi-device accessible. This ensures that your content remains responsive, optimised and up-to-date.**

By now, you'll have your content development plan set up to locate new [ways to improve customer experience](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/blog/ways-to-improve-customer-experience/). When you direct customers to your website, depending on how they browse and most probably what environment they are in, they’ll be reviewing your website on either a phone, tablet, laptop or large screen. It is essential to make sure that the web page they land on accommodates this. Initially, the concept of making a website that accommodates ALL device types can be daunting. New technology is continuously being developed in addition to the plethora of devices that are already on the market. But, luckily for you, there's a brilliant way to optimise your website to keep it responsive for most devices. Creating a mobile friendly website design will automatically ensure your website content and features appear quickly to your viewers.

Website speed optimisation is a silent hero in the marketing world. A slow website can lead to higher bounce rates and an increase in user dissatisfaction. If a user can't access your website it’s a real problem for them **and** you, especially considering the effort, spend, and revenue put towards getting them to your website in the first place. We recommend taking the risk out of the equation by presenting content that fits the device they are viewing. Making your website mobile friendly can optimise your content to match the device viewing it. For example, if you're meeting a client and want to show them the key points of your company, an offline accessible mobile design will help you to showcase your company on the go, regardless of any Wi-Fi or reception.
