If you're an internet user, then you will have noticed that the ‘.uk’ domain name has been around for a while now. It was introduced around June 2014 as a compacted replacement for the more common ‘.co.uk’. This abbreviated name quickly became incredibly popular and was widely implemented across well-known websites. When companies like the BBC are moving over to ‘.uk’, you know it’s here to stay! That's why this blog is going to outline the reasons why it's time to grab your ‘.uk’ domain.

Why was ‘.uk’ introduced in the first place? In addition to being shorter and faster to type, its introduction aimed to bring us in line with other countries. France, for example, use ‘.fr’ and Ireland use ‘.ir’. Each country began using domains to represent where their website was originating from. It became a stamp of identity and representation across the globe. Regardless of its origin, the fact is that ‘.uk’ is now being widely used by low and high-profile companies alike. So it's important that you don’t get left behind!

Sure, popularity and efficiency are two good reasons to buy up your ‘.uk’ domain. However, there is another extremely good reason to claim your domain as soon as you can. Many companies, of which you may be one, make sure they are in possession of every related domain ending under the sun when it comes to their business. If you are not the owner of an available domain ending, there is nothing to stop your competitor from snatching it up and claiming huge chunks of your internet traffic and, subsequently a chunk of your business.

## Your right to a ‘.uk’ domain

Now, here’s the good news. If you have the rights to the ‘.co.uk’ version of your domain, then, providing you registered it before June 2014, you already have the legal right to the ‘.uk’ version. However, this is only valid until June 2019, so get in there as soon as you can! There are also ways to acquire the rights to your ‘.uk’ domain via ownership of other address endings…

- UK: If you own the ‘.org.uk’ domain for your business then the rights to your ‘.uk’ domain should be awarded without too much trouble if the .co.uk.’ domain is available. (Your ‘.org.uk’ must also have been registered before June 2014).
- .ME.UK: If ‘.me.uk’ is what you use, then you can acquire your ‘.uk’ domain providing both ‘.org.uk’ and ‘.co.uk’ are available. (Again, pre-June 2014 registration is required).

If you are thinking about moving over to ‘.uk’, do make sure that your SEO rankings remain stable, and that Google is informed of the changes.
