But there will have been a few familiar phrases that we used throughout our steps: **data** and **analytics**. Whether you're a fresh-faced junior marketer or a professional associate, you will have to handle data and analytics at some point. That's why, in this blog, we want to provide you with some helpful tips and tools to make understanding and utilising marketing analytics easier.

Marketing analytics is the driving force of every campaign, strategy and company. It reflects how successful your marketing is and where to implement improvements. We have covered how data collected about your customers and their experiences is priceless when it comes to adjusting site navigation and customer journey. We have also discussed how you can set up CRM systems to process communications and implement changes. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. All data and analytics translate to feedback about you and your company. So it's important to consistently conduct iterative reviews of your techniques and services.

Tracking and recording your data will allow you to measure the effectiveness of your techniques and services. These measurements can provide a cross-comparison to pinpoint where strengths lie within your marketing efforts. This way, you can monitor how great your return on investment is in specific areas. It can also reveal whether you should broaden your marketing approach to yield greater results in other marketing areas. Every company is unique, which means that some digital analytic tools will work better for some than others. By following the strategic process that we have outlined in our guidebook, we hope that you will feel more confident in choosing a digital tool that's right for you.

Digital tools are always available to provide a structured framework to test various marketing channels. Here are some of the free, paid and wider reaching tools to consider for recording and calculating marketing analytics:
