## Once you’re on a roll with the blog writing, you need to make the most of it on your social media accounts.

## If you’re writing a blog every week or two, we need to find four or five bits of content to go with each blog for socials. So, have a look online for things related to your blog – they could be images of film clips or different uses for this week’s deal.

We’ve created a template for blogging and social media for you so that you can feed in blog ideas as you have them and keep track of which posts you’re going to put live and when. This gives you the breathing room to make any changes or rearrangements without throwing your posting schedule completely off track. This allows you to take more time creating a solid story or narrative across your socials, which can leave longer-lasting impressions on users. It also means that you can plan your social media content in advance and then schedule it using Hootsuite so that you can spend, say, half a day each week on it rather than constantly having to go in and out of [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/eblueprintltd), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eblueprint), etc.

We’re focusing on your current two accounts:

1. Facebook
2. Twitter
3. Plus Hootsuite - your social media management tool
