## **So, how does SEO work?**

### **Planning, planning, and more planning**

The key to getting a great SEO ranking is through extensive planning. A tip for achieving this is to try and get it as right as possible the first time around. No plan may leave you repeatedly trying to edit, fix and improve your ranking. Updates and edits will always need to happen! But getting as much market research under your belt as possible in the first place makes implementing those updates faster and much more efficient. You will gather a huge amount of valuable data to use across your website. In addition, you will also be able to refer back to your research for past, present and future tracking, posts, and brainstorming. Broad research is also just as important as niche and refined research, as it could uncover some alternative ideas or perspectives that you may not have considered had you not explored these different areas. Start gathering as much information as you can as soon as you can!

## Establish your unique selling points

To do this, set some time aside to research what makes your content unique – you could do this by identifying your target customers. Use these unique attributes as your starting points, as they will help your content match your customers’ specific wants and needs. When it comes to catching your audiences’ eyes, it sells to be unique, and you will soon discover that SEO highlights how the most popular searches aren’t always the most profitable.

Imagine you’re selling a new twist on the classic and well-loved spaghetti Bolognese recipe. There are going to be LOTS of other companies and manufacturers selling a similar product who will be fighting over that top search spot. So, how do we get to first place? This is where the strategy behind those unique selling points comes in. The chances of a brand new product overtaking top sellers are unlikely. However, if a customer is searching for a niche variant, such as a vegan Bolognese recipe, you will stand a much better chance of landing a place in those first few pages of search results. Companies create products and services to fill a gap in the market, and SEO is the perfect place for you to showcase exactly what that market gap is and how you satisfy it. SEO doesn’t have to be scary; it’s about letting your company’s individuality shine.
