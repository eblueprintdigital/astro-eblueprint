## **So, how does SEO work?**

### **Planning, planning, and more planning**

The key to getting a great SEO ranking is through extensive planning. A tip for achieving this is to try and get it as right as possible the first time around. No plan may leave you repeatedly trying to edit, fix and improve your ranking. Updates and edits will always need to happen! But getting as much market research under your belt as possible in the first place makes implementing those updates faster and much more efficient. You will gather a huge amount of valuable data to use across your website. In addition, you will also be able to refer back to your research for past, present and future tracking, posts, and brainstorming. Broad research is also just as important as niche and refined research, as it could uncover some alternative ideas or perspectives that you may not have considered had you not explored these different areas. Start gathering as much information as you can as soon as you can!
