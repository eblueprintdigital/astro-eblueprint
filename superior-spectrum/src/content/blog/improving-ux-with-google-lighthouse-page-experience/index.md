## One of the most significant Google algorithm updates in years is using real-life user experiences. [Google Page Experience](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10218333?hl=en) measures and monitors your website’s performance, from speed to usability and ease on mobile and desktop devices.

Let’s break down how Google Page Experience benefits your business:

- [**Website speed**](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/services/web-development/) – precisely, web page speed. How fast does your web page load from the search results page to accessing your website? Frustrated users will leave your website if it loads too slowly. Therefore, Google’s search engine replaces slower websites with optimised sites that perform better. Including animated graphics, video, and functionality (such as application forms or enquiries) is an excellent way of optimising your site. Your web code needs to stay updated, however, to load efficiently.

- **Security** – Google’s requirements have always prioritised security and user data. Therefore, your website’s coding, the web hosting server’s performance, and IP reputation impact your rankings. A technical SEO audit will help determine any holes in your website’s capability and how that could affect your users’ experience of your website and business. There are also additional ways of protecting user data. Using HTTPS (SSL certification) encrypts the user data sent from your website across the internet. This protects user data and your rankings. Moreover, as of 2017, sites without an SSL certificate are penalised.
