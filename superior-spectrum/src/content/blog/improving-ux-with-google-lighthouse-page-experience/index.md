## One of the most significant Google algorithm updates in years is using real-life user experiences. [Google Page Experience](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10218333?hl=en) measures and monitors your website’s performance, from speed to usability and ease on mobile and desktop devices.

Let’s break down how Google Page Experience benefits your business:

- [**Website speed**](/services/web-development/) – precisely, web page speed. How fast does your web page load from the search results page to accessing your website? Frustrated users will leave your website if it loads too slowly. Therefore, Google’s search engine replaces slower websites with optimised sites that perform better. Including animated graphics, video, and functionality (such as application forms or enquiries) is an excellent way of optimising your site. Your web code needs to stay updated, however, to load efficiently.

- **Security** – Google’s requirements have always prioritised security and user data. Therefore, your website’s coding, the web hosting server’s performance, and IP reputation impact your rankings. A technical SEO audit will help determine any holes in your website’s capability and how that could affect your users’ experience of your website and business. There are also additional ways of protecting user data. Using HTTPS (SSL certification) encrypts the user data sent from your website across the internet. This protects user data and your rankings. Moreover, as of 2017, sites without an SSL certificate are penalised.

- **Accessibility** – Google is the ultimate internet user. So, Google will reward your website if you make it accessible to all kinds of users. Catering for visual and auditory impairments not only helps you reach a wider audience but also improves your website ranking. From editing colour contrast to font size, e-blueprint builds accessible websites with a full range of double AA compliance. Improve your website’s accessibility and social impact today.

- **Usability** – Have you ever considered how easy it is for users to engage with your website? Does every page load fast enough? How well is your information structured? Can people instantly find what they need, or are they experiencing inconsistencies and struggling to find the right content? A usability audit, consisting of video use, task analysis, and tracking tools, can reveal users’ common pitfalls and frustrations for you to fix.

- **Mobile friendly** – modern websites respond to different sized devices, with more advanced websites offering mobile-specific content to improve experiences. Your rankings will deplete if your users experience poor usability when content. Making your website mobile friendly is a great way to adhere to Google’s Page Experience standards.

- **Web Apps** and continuous content – can users access your content even without Wi-Fi? Google encourages website owners to allow their users a continuous service through powerful web apps (PWAs). These can be installed by creating a mobile version of your website, which makes an APP icon on a user’s device. This APP then downloads content every time your mobile connects to the internet and caches that version, including documents, games, and various pre-loaded offline content. This means that users can access this content even offline, meaning that a lack of Wi-Fi won’t implicate user experience. Don’t let poor internet connection stop you from connecting with people.
