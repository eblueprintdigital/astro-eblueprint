## **What is GDPR?**

General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) is what it stands for. Cybercrime and misuse of data cases are becoming more and more common; data protection has very quickly become an important issue. The general public is increasingly aware of the potential threat when it comes to their personal data and therefore the expectation for businesses to have a good [strategy](https://ebp-copy.eblue-hosting.co.uk/services/consultancy/) when it comes to protecting that data is higher than ever before.

The GDPR will come into enforcement throughout Europe on May 25th 2018. It aims to create a uniform standard of protection across the continent and give citizens more control over their personal data, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, bank and credit cards, e-mail addresses and IP addresses.

This will change the way businesses collect, store, record and process personal data on a global scale, despite it being an EU specific law.  If ignored, this law can see a business fined up to £17.5m, or up to 4% of your WORLDWIDE revenues PER INSTANCE. So – are you taking notice now?

### How It Affects Your Data Storing Practices…

Basically, the new GDPR is designed to ensure that businesses only collect essential data; it must be legitimate, explicit and specified. If you deal with sensitive data, here are some practices that you will need to implement and adhere to:

- All data must be lawfully and transparently processed.
- The data collected must be limited to only what is essential and relevant to your business.
- All data must be up to date.
- ‘Maximum security’ conditions must be applied to the processing of personal data.
- The identity of an individual must only be available when their information is being processed, and only when they have given permission.
- “The right to be forgotten”: All personal data should be able to be deleted on request.
- You must have a clear and visible complaints procedure.
- Data on minors (under 13) can only be held with their guardian’s permission.
- ‘Opt in’ replaces ‘opt out’.

Does your company comply with all of these? If not, then maybe it is time to review your data processing protocols. If you are not sure, why not take a look at these [12 tips on how to prepare for these new regulations](https://ico.org.uk/media/1624219/preparing-for-the-gdpr-12-steps.pdf).

### GDPR is about protecting personal data so does that mean it affect’s business data?

The short answer is yes. It might be there are some express exceptions to the rule when it comes to blanket email addresses, but essentially, if you have an ability to track down an email address to a person then its ‘personal’. Why run the risk? Read more here.

### GDPR After Brexit

You may have picked up that GDPR is indeed and EU law. As we know, the UK is not going to be part of the EU for too much longer. The government has confirmed that it intends to bring the GDPR into UK law after the EU break, so fear not, if you change your practices now, they will still be relevant once we are on the other side of Brexit.

### e-Commerce Stores and Payment Gateways

Most e-commerce systems process payments outside of the business by way of platforms such as Paypal, Worldplay, SAGEpay and Stripe. This makes them PCI compliant. However, if your payments pass directly through your network, i.e. if credit card and bank details pass through your system, you may be in breach of your compliance. If there is a breach of such sensitive data in your network, you may be liable to fines. Make sure you check this out!
